# Web Security Assessment of Higher Education Institutions in the United States (2024)

This repository contains a dataset resulting from a cybersecurity investigation conducted on the websites of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the United States [1]. The purpose of this research is to assess the state of web security across educational institutions. The data is being shared to contribute to open science and public knowledge [2]. The data collection took place on November 3, 2024.

The repository includes:
- Raw Data – The unprocessed results obtained from scanning HEI websites.
- Aggregated Data – Analyzed results, providing insights into security implementations based on the type of institution (public or private), and regional analysis by state.

## Methodology

1. Data Source: The list of higher education institutions was sourced from an external dataset [3].
2. Security Scanning: A web security scanner [4] was used to evaluate key parameters such as:
 -  DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions);
 -  HTTPS implementation;
 -  AXFR (DNS Zone Transfer);
 -  Security headers;
3. Data Aggregation: The raw results were processed through an analyzer [5], consolidating the data to provide insights by state and institution type.
4. Resulting Files: The aggregated analysis files are available in the root directory of this repository.
